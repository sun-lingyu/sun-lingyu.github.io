I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am honored to be advised by [Prof. Chao Li]([https://www.XXX.com/](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~lichao/index.html)) of the Sustainable Architecture and Infrastructure Lab ([SAIL](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/sail/)) from the Emerging Parallel Computing Center ([EPCC](http://epcc.sjtu.edu.cn/en/index)), Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Before pursuing my PhD, I earned my BS degree from the IEEE honor class of Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

Research interest
======
My research interests include machine learning systems, real-time systems, and computer architecture. I devise innovative cross-layer approaches to improve the performance and efficiency of today's computing infrastructure. I am currently focusing on the management and design of the computing stack of autonomous systems, especially autonomous vehicles.
